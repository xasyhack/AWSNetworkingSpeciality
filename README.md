# Design and Implement AWS networks
**Intro**
- what features:
- whwat considerations:
- different parts of VPC
- troubleshoot and secure VPC

### AWS Global Infrastructure 
**Core Components**
- **Regions**: Physically isolated locations worldwide with multiple Availability Zones (AZs). E.g `us-east-1`
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: One or more data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity. Low-latency links connect AZs. E.g `us-east-1a`. **Availability Zone ID** uniquely identify each physical AZ (use for cross account architecture). E.g `use1-az1`
- **Edge Locations**: Used by Amazon CloudFront to cache content closer to users.
- **Regional Edge Caches**: Act as a mid-tier cache between edge locations and origin servers.
- **Local Zones**: Extend AWS services closer to users in metro areas for ultra-low latency.
- **Wavelength Zones**: Embed AWS services within 5G networks of telco providers.

**Networking Impact**
- **High Availability**:
  - Use multiple AZs for fault-tolerant design.
  - Services like VPC subnets are AZ-specific; services like IAM and S3 are global/regional.
- **Latency Optimization**:
  - Use CloudFront, Route 53, and Local Zones for low-latency delivery.
- **Resiliency**:
  - Inter-AZ traffic is high-throughput and low-latency.
  - Design for multi-AZ and multi-Region redundancy.

**Region Design Considerations**
- **Service Availability** varies by region.
- **Compliance & Data Residency**:
  - Select regions to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR).
- **Pricing** differs between regions.

**AWS Global Network**
- AWS owns a **private global backbone** network.
- **Direct Connect** uses AWS backbone, avoiding the public internet.
- Designed for **low-latency, high-throughput** communication between regions and AZs.

**Global vs. Regional Services**
| Global Services                    | Regional Services            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, WAF    | EC2, VPC, RDS, Lambda        |

**Design Best Practices**
- Use **VPC Endpoints** to avoid public internet when connecting to AWS services.
- For **multi-region** design:
  - Use **inter-region VPC Peering** or **Transit Gateway peering**.
  - Note: Inter-region VPC peering is non-transitive.
- Monitor and troubleshoot using:
  - **VPC Flow Logs**
  - **Reachability Analyzer**
  - **CloudWatch**

### Private and Public AWS Services
- Public AWS Services: Services accessed over the public internet (Without VPC). E.g S3, Lambda, SNS/SQS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront. Secure via IAM policies, VPC endpoints, WAF or CloudFront.
- Private AWS Services: Services not exposed to the public internet (contained within your VPC); require private IP address to access. E.g EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, EFS, PrivateLink . Secure via security groups, network ACLs, Route tables

### Disaster Recovery and High Availability
| Aspect              | High Availability (HA)                         | Fault Tolerance (FT)                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Definition          | Ensures a system is **continuously operational** with minimal downtime.  | Ensures a system **continues to operate perfectly** even when components fail.  |
| Goal                | Minimize **downtime**                         | Ensure **zero impact** during failures           |
| Downtime Tolerance  | Minimal downtime allowed                      | No downtime allowed                              |
| Recovery            | May require **failover** or **restart**       | No recovery needed; system runs **seamlessly**   |
| Cost                | Lower cost than FT                            | Higher cost due to **redundancy**                |
| Example             | Active-Passive Load Balancer                  | RAID 1, EC2 with auto-recovery, redundant power  |
