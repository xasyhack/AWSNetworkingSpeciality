## Design and Implement AWS networks

### ðŸ“– AWS Global Infrastructure 
**Core Components**
- **Regions**: Physically isolated locations worldwide with multiple Availability Zones (AZs). E.g `us-east-1`
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: One or more data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity. Low-latency links connect AZs. E.g `us-east-1a`. **Availability Zone ID** uniquely identify each physical AZ (use for cross account architecture). E.g `use1-az1`
- **Edge Locations**: Used by Amazon CloudFront to cache content closer to users.
- **Regional Edge Caches**: Act as a mid-tier cache between edge locations and origin servers.
- **Local Zones**: Extend AWS services closer to users in metro areas for ultra-low latency.
- **Wavelength Zones**: Embed AWS services within 5G networks of telco providers.

**Networking Impact**
- **High Availability**:
  - Use multiple AZs for fault-tolerant design.
  - Services like VPC subnets are AZ-specific; services like IAM and S3 are global/regional.
- **Latency Optimization**:
  - Use CloudFront, Route 53, and Local Zones for low-latency delivery.
- **Resiliency**:
  - Inter-AZ traffic is high-throughput and low-latency.
  - Design for multi-AZ and multi-Region redundancy.

**Region Design Considerations**
- **Service Availability** varies by region.
- **Compliance & Data Residency**:
  - Select regions to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR).
- **Pricing** differs between regions.

**AWS Global Network**
- AWS owns a **private global backbone** network.
- **Direct Connect** uses AWS backbone, avoiding the public internet.
- Designed for **low-latency, high-throughput** communication between regions and AZs.

**Global vs. Regional Services**
| Global Services                    | Regional Services            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, WAF    | EC2, VPC, RDS, Lambda        |

**Design Best Practices**
- Use **VPC Endpoints** to avoid public internet when connecting to AWS services.
- For **multi-region** design:
  - Use **inter-region VPC Peering** or **Transit Gateway peering**.
  - Note: Inter-region VPC peering is non-transitive.
- Monitor and troubleshoot using:
  - **VPC Flow Logs**
  - **Reachability Analyzer**
  - **CloudWatch**

### ðŸ“– Private and Public AWS Services
- Public AWS Services: Services accessed over the public internet (Without VPC). E.g S3, Lambda, SNS/SQS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront. Secure via IAM policies, VPC endpoints, WAF or CloudFront.
- Private AWS Services: Services not exposed to the public internet (contained within your VPC); require private IP address to access. E.g EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, EFS, PrivateLink . Secure via security groups, network ACLs, Route tables

### ðŸ“– Disaster Recovery and High Availability
| Aspect              | High Availability (HA)                         | Fault Tolerance (FT)                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Definition          | Ensures a system is **continuously operational** with minimal downtime.  | Ensures a system **continues to operate perfectly** even when components fail.  |
| Goal                | Minimize **downtime**                         | Ensure **zero impact** during failures           |
| Downtime Tolerance  | Minimal downtime allowed                      | No downtime allowed                              |
| Recovery            | May require **failover** or **restart**       | No recovery needed; system runs **seamlessly**   |
| Cost                | Lower cost than FT                            | Higher cost due to **redundancy**                |
| Example             | Active-Passive Load Balancer                  | RAID 1, EC2 with auto-recovery, redundant power  |

### ðŸ“– VPC Basic Networking Design
**What Is a VPC?**
- A logically isolated network within AWS cloud.
- You define IP ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways, and security settings.
- Acts like your own private data center in the cloud.

**CIDR Block**
- Calculate the number of IPv4 addresses in a /24 subnet IP CIDR.
  Example: `10.0.0.0/24` â†’ 32 - /24 = 2^8 = 256 host IPs - 5 reserved IPs = 251 available host IPs

**Subnets**
| Type        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Public**  | Has a route to the internet via IGW. |
| **Private** | No direct route to internet. Access via NAT Gateway. |
- One subnet = one AZ.
- Multiple subnets = multi-AZ architecture (for HA).

**VPC Core Components**
| Component           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Subnets**         | Divide VPC into smaller networks (public/private). |
| **Route Tables**    | Define network traffic paths. |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Enables internet access for public subnets. |
| **NAT Gateway/Instance** | Allows private subnets to access the internet. |
| **Security Groups** | Stateful firewall rules at the instance level. |
| **Network ACLs**    | Stateless firewall rules at the subnet level. |
| **Elastic IPs**     | Static public IP addresses. |
| **DHCP Options Set**| Controls DNS resolution behavior in the VPC. |

**Internet Gateway vs. NAT Gateway**
| Feature              | Internet Gateway             | NAT Gateway                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Public IP required?  | Yes                          | Yes (Elastic IP attached)        |
| Direction            | Inbound & Outbound           | Outbound only                    |
| Use case             | Public access (e.g. web app) | Internet access for private subnets |

**VPC Peering**
- Connect two VPCs (same or different regions/accounts).
- Uses AWS backbone; **no transitive peering**.
- Must update route tables manually.

**VPC Endpoints**
| Type           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Interface Endpoint** | Private IP access to AWS services via ENI (e.g. S3, SNS). |
| **Gateway Endpoint**   | For **S3 and DynamoDB** only. Uses route table entry. |

**VPC Flow Logs**
- Capture **network traffic metadata** for analysis.
- Can be sent to **CloudWatch Logs** or **S3**.
- Useful for troubleshooting or compliance.

**VPC Limits (default, can be increased)**
- 5 VPCs per region.
- 200 subnets per VPC.
- 500 security groups per VPC.
- 50 route tables per VPC.

**Tips for AWS Advanced Networking Exam â€“ VPC Focus**
- Understand CIDR math
  - Be quick with subnetting calculations
  - Know how many IPs are in `/16`, `/24`, `/28`, etc
  - Remember: 5 IPs are reserved per subnet (first 4 + last)
- Know routing logic
  - How routing tables determine traffic flow
  - Difference between local routes, IGW, NAT, and VPC peering entries
- VPC Peering vs Transit Gateway vs PrivateLink
  - VPC Peering: One-to-one, no transitive routing.
  - Transit Gateway (TGW): One-to-many, scalable hub-spoke.
  - PrivateLink: Service-centric, internal access via ENI.
- Security Groups vs NACLs
  - Security Groups: Stateful, instance-level.
  - NACLs: Stateless, subnet-level, order of rules matters.
- Internet Gateway vs NAT Gateway
  - Understand which subnet requires which component
  - Know use cases: public-facing EC2 vs. internal EC2 needing updates
- VPC Endpoints
  - Gateway endpoints: for S3/DynamoDB only, free, added in route tables.
  - Interface endpoints: private IPs, cost per hour + data, supported for most AWS services.
- IPv6 in VPCs
  - Dual-stack enabled.
  - No NAT with IPv6.
  - IGW required for IPv6 internet access.
- VPC Flow Logs & Reachability Analyzer
  - VPC Flow Logs for traffic metadata (no payload).
  - Use Reachability Analyzer for **packet path tracing**.
- Hybrid Networking
  - Understand how VPC connects to on-prem via **Site-to-Site VPN** or **Direct Connect**.
  - Know HA configurations: multiple tunnels, BGP, VGW.

### ðŸ“– Default VPC
- Automatically created by AWS in each region (per account).

| Feature                 | Default VPC Behavior                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Subnets                | 1 public subnet per AZ in the region           |
| Internet Gateway (IGW) | Attached by default                            |
| Route Table            | Routes `0.0.0.0/0` to the IGW                  |
| Network ACLs           | Allow all inbound and outbound by default      |
| Security Group         | Default SG allows all outbound, no inbound     |
| CIDR Range             | `172.31.0.0/16`                                |
| Auto-assign Public IP  | Enabled by default                             |

### ðŸ“– Subnets, VPC Routers, and Route tables
**Subnets**
- A **subnet** is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.
- **Types**:
  - **Public Subnet**: Has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
  - **Private Subnet**: No direct route to IGW; uses NAT for outbound internet.
  - **Isolated Subnet**: No internet access (no IGW/NAT).
- **Subnet Sizing**:
  - Must be within the VPC CIDR range.
  - Cannot overlap with other subnets in the same VPC.
  - Size range: `/28` (16 IPs) to `/16` (65,536 IPs).
  - AWS reserves **5 IPs** per subnet (network address, broadcast address, etc.).
- Subnets are tied to a **single Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- **Multiple subnets can exist per AZ**, commonly for separating public/private workloads.

**VPC Router**
- The **VPC Router** is an implicit, AWS-managed component.
- It routes traffic **within the VPC and to external targets** based on route tables.
- Operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**.
- You **cannot configure it directly** â€” behavior is controlled by **route tables**.
- VPC Router supports routing to:
  - `local` (default within VPC)
  - Internet Gateway (IGW)
  - NAT Gateway / NAT Instance
  - Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
  - Transit Gateway (TGW)
  - VPC Peering
  - Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

**Route Tables**
- **Route Table** defines how traffic is directed within a VPC.
- Every subnet must be associated with exactly **one** route table.
- One route table is the **main** route table by default.

| Destination     | Target Example               | Use Case                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `local`         | Always present                | Intra-VPC communication             |
| `0.0.0.0/0`     | IGW or NAT Gateway            | Internet-bound traffic              |
| Specific CIDRs  | VGW, Peering, TGW             | VPN, Peered VPC, Transit routing    |

- **Custom Route Tables** can be created for:
  - Public subnets (route to IGW)
  - Private subnets (route to NAT Gateway)
  - VPN / TGW connectivity
    
- **Routing Logic**:
  - Longest prefix match wins
  - Example:
    - `10.0.0.0/16` â†’ Peering
    - `10.0.1.0/24` â†’ NAT
    - Traffic to `10.0.1.5` uses `10.0.1.0/24` route

**ðŸ§  Exam Tips**
- Know when to use:
  - IGW vs NAT Gateway
  - Peering vs Transit Gateway
- Understand route table propagation:
  - VGW and TGW can **propagate routes** into route tables
- Isolated subnet = **no route** to IGW or NAT
- Public subnet = **must have**:
  - Route to IGW
  - Public IP / Elastic IP assigned to the instance
- Multiple subnets can share one route table
- Route tables apply at **subnet level**, not instance level

### ðŸ“– IP Party: BYOIP
- **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)** allows you to bring your **public IPv4 or IPv6 address ranges** to AWS.
- AWS advertises these IPs on your behalf, enabling you to:
  - Maintain existing IP reputation and branding.
  - Use static IPs across AWS services.
  - Support legacy systems requiring fixed IPs.
  - 
**Requirements**
- **IP Range**: Must be a **/24 IPv4** or **/56 IPv6** block.
- **Ownership**: IPs must be registered to your organization with a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) like **ARIN**, **RIPE**, or **APNIC**.
- **Authorization**: Create a **Route Origin Authorization (ROA)** for AWS ASNs **16509** and **14618**.
- **Verification**: Prove control via:
  - **X.509 certificate** if RIR supports RDAP.
  - **DNS TXT record** using Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM).
 
**Use Cases**
- **Global Accelerator**: Assign BYOIP addresses to accelerators for consistent IPs globally.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Use BYOIP Elastic IPs for frontend IPs.
- **Legacy Applications**: Maintain existing IPs to avoid reconfiguration.
- **Content Localization**: Combine BYOIP with **RFC 8805** for precise geolocation control.
 
**BYOIP Workflow**
1. **Prepare**: Ensure IP range meets AWS requirements.
2. **Authorize**: Set up ROA with your RIR.
3. **Provision**: Submit BYOIP request in AWS.
4. **Advertise**: AWS begins advertising your IP range.
5. **Allocate**: Create Elastic IPs from your BYOIP pool.
6. **Assign**: Attach Elastic IPs to AWS resources (e.g., EC2, NLB).

**ðŸ§  Exam Tips**
- **BYOIP** is ideal for scenarios requiring **static, recognizable public IPs**.
- **ROA** is mandatory for AWS to advertise your IP range.
- **Elastic IPs** from BYOIP pools can be used with services like **EC2**, **NAT Gateway**, and **NLB**.
- **Global Accelerator** supports BYOIP for consistent IP addresses across regions.
- **IP Reputation**: AWS may reject IP ranges with poor reputation.
